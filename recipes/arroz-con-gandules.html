        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 green bell peppers (diced)</li>
                <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
                <li>6 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
                <li>1 bunch of cliantro (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
                <li>15 ounces of tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 0.25 oz package of Spanish seasoning</li>
                <li>3 cups of uncooked brown rice</li>
                <li>2 15 oz cans of pigeon peas (drained)</li>
                <li>6 cups of boiling water</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step by Step</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend your peppers, onion, garlic and cilantro until it becomes a puree. This is called Sofrito, and is the base of your seasoning. Sofrito can be stored in an airtight container in your fridge for up to two weeks, or in the freezer for up to 6 months</li>
                <li>Place 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 6 tablespoons of sofrito in an 8 quart saucepan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes</li>
                <li>Pour one can of tomato sauce and your Spanish seasoning into the saucepan, and be sure to mix them well. In this step, you will also add your 3 cups of rice to the mixture and stir until the rice is completely coated.</li>
                <li>Stir your pigeon peas into the mixture and add boiling water. Cover your pot with aluminum and a pot lid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the rice cook for 45 minutes, or until the rice is tender.</li>
            </ol>
